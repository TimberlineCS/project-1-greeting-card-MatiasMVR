## Compiling and Using

To run the program, go to the file named project 1 in this computer's desktop and open the index page.

## Discussion

I didn't have too much trouble throughout the project. I started with creating the divs and started coding. I started with the background card and then created the tree. I had a little bit of trouble with creating the triangles, but once I made the first one I had little trouble with the others. I then layered several circles to create the snowman and finished it. After that, I created the header and put text over it. I then used the code in the README to insert music into the card.

Overall, I only had a little trouble during the project with the triangles and the music, but the rest was fairly straighforward.
